Apart from a C++ compiler, a number of development libraries need to be present to enable Qt Creator to build your Qt applications. On Debian and Ubuntu, use the following command in a terminal to make sure they are installed:

  sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev libSM-dev libxrender-dev libfontconfig1-dev libxext-dev

If you're using QtOpenGL, you'll also need OpenGL development files. You can use the following command to find out which packages to install:

  sudo apt-get install libgl-dev libglu-dev
